    <p>My journey with programming and developments began in 2020 3 months into the pandemic and i decided to put all my efforts into a coding bootcamp to get started into a career i knew id love! The boot camp i went to is Coding Dojo, While there I learned basic frontend web development like HTML CSS and JS. We then began to learn backend development, and thats when i really started having a party. Backend development helped me understand how to code and how to read others code.We learned python and flask for the backend developments, and with that I learned how to get data and display it onto the webpage, how to route to different web pages. We also really got into OOP with python and PTDD (python test driven development.</p>
